on","answer":""},{"id":32,"title":"What are `let` and `const`?","answer":"New to ES6, `let` and `const` allow us to set variables in lexical scope (or block scope)"},{"id":4,"title":"What are some Native Array methods and what would you use them for?","answer":"Some common Array methods are `.pop(), .push(), .shift(), .unshift()` for adding / removing data from an Array. For looping through data, you can use `.forEach()` or `.map(), .reduce()` to manipulate or accumulate data. Using `.filter(), .every(), .some()` can check if your data includes what you're looking for."},{"id":5,"title":"When would you use a `for` loop over `.forEach()`?","answer":"A `.forEach()` loop will go through all items in the Array while a `for` loop can be cancelled early with a `break` statement."},{"id":6,"title":"What's the difference between encrypting and encoding a string?","answer":"Encoding is changing the format of the data so that it can be transferred but does not require a key to reverse and isn't a secure method of transfer. Encryption requires a key to reverse and is used to transmit/store data securely."},{"id":7,"title":"When is a value `null` vs `undefined` vs undeclared?","answer":"If we define a variable without a value it will be `undefined`. If we want to declare the value as \"empty\" we can set it to `null`. If we have never mentioned this variable before, it will be considered undeclared."},{"id":8,"title":"What are the three states of a Promise?","answer":"Pending, we have initiated the code and are awaiting a response. Resolved, we have successfully returned a value. Failed, an error state when we did not receive what we expected."},{"id":9,"title":"What are the six Primitive Data Types in JavaScript?","answer":"String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined and new to ES6, Symbol."},{"id":10,"title":"What is the difference between Git and Github?","answer":"Git is a Source Control system while Github is a hosting platform for Git repositories. Github has features like Forks, Pull Requests, and Issues."},{"id":11,"title":"What is the difference between a Library and a Framework?","answer":"Generally, a Framework will include lots of functionality packaged together. For example, AngularJS includes Components, Client-side routing, build tools, etc. A Library will usually specialize around a specific task or tasks. For example, jQuery is helpful for DOM manipulation and momentJS is helpful for working with Dates."},{"id":12,"title":"Why would we want to host our files on a CDN?","answer":"A CDN will provide performance benefits such as a global network, cookie-less domains, and hard caching rules to ensure quick delivery times."},{"id":14,"title":"What kind of files would count as Static Assets?","answer":"Any files that do not need additional processing, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Additionally, any kind of media files such as photos (jpg, png), videos (mov, mp4), documents (pdf, txt, md)."},{"id":15,"title":"Explain the difference between Arguments and Parameters","answer":"Parameters are defined with the function while Arguments are what is being passed to the function when it is invoked."},{"id":16,"title":"What would we use `.call()` and `.apply()` for?","answer":"`.call()` and `.apply()` can be used to invoke a function or method with a specific context"},{"id":17,"title":"What kind of requests can we make with AJAX?","answer":"AJAX can (most commonly) make `GET, POST, PUT / PATCH, DELETE` requests. We can also make `OPTIONS, HEAD` requests if necessary."},{"id":18,"title":"What is CORS and why does it exist?","answer":"CORS stands for Cross-origin Resource Sharing. It is implemented into browsers as a security feature to prevent one domain from requesting information to another domain without permission. We can set up our server to allow CORS requests if our data is intended to be publicly available."},{"id":19,"title":"What are the (dis)advantages to using CSS Grid over Flexbox?","answer":"Flexbox is intended to distribute space among items in a container, even when their width is not know. CSS Grid allows us to create a row and column layout while keeping control of each items placement in the grid."},{"id":20,"title":"What are CSS floats best used for?","answer":"CSS Floats are intended to pull an element out of the web page flow such as an image with text around it. Floats should not be used for layout now Flexbox and Grid are available."},{"id":21,"title":"What does \"the page flow\" refer to in HTML / CSS?","answer":"When talking about \"the page flow\", we are indicating the order which elements get rendered to the page. Elements can be pulled out of the flow, which allows us to place things absolute, fixed, or as a float."},{"id":22,"title":"Tell me what Promises are and why would I use them?","answer":"Promises provide a way for us to handle asynchronous code. We can use a Promise that will resolve when the result is returned, or reject if unsuccessful.
